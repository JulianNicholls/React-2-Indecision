# React-2-Indecision
Indecision App from The Complete React Web Developer Course (2nd Edition) by Andrew Mead at https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/learn/v4/content

## Progress

Completed section 4 - React Components

## Differences from Andrew

I have skipped retyping some of the playground tutorials and exercises, 
e.g. Arrow functions, Classes.

## Git client

I have used Git at the command-line for 10 years.
Over that time, I have tried many different graphical shells for Git,
without finding one that was easier and nicer to use than the command-line
(in my view).

I have now found that [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) is an excellent
Git shell and would advise using it to everyone.
